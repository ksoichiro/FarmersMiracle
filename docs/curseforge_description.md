## ✨ Features

### 🏛️ 3 Temple Structures
- **Temple of Golden Wheat** — A shrine dedicated to wheat, hidden in the wilderness
- **Temple of Pumpkins** — A temple celebrating the pumpkin harvest
- **Temple of Melons** — A tropical temple honoring melons
- All temples generate within 2000 blocks of the initial spawn point
- Minimum 300+ blocks distance between temples
- Found in plains, forests, taigas, savannas, meadows, and more

### 🔮 Collectible Orbs
Each temple chest contains a unique orb:
- **Wheat Orb** — from the Temple of Golden Wheat
- **Pumpkin Orb** — from the Temple of Pumpkins
- **Melon Orb** — from the Temple of Melons

### 🏆 Advancements
- Triggered by obtaining each orb
- A final advancement for collecting all three orbs

### 🌱 Permanent Crop Growth Buffs
Each advancement grants **"Blessing of Grains"** buffs:
- **Growth I–IV**: Increases crop growth speed (stacks with each orb collected, +3% per level)
- **Spread I**: Expands buff range from 16 to 24 blocks (granted by collecting all 3 orbs)
- **Target crops**: Wheat, Pumpkin, Melon, Potato, Carrot, Beetroot
